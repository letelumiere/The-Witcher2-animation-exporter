# The-Witcher2-assets-xml

it is just xml files, scripts from The witcher2's files, 'witcher_steel.w2anims', which is consist in 'pack0.dzip'. using REDKIT.
I don't know how exactly they work on 3d graphic tools. but I would be find how import to blenders.

p.s :
you can extracts '*.dzip' using 'Gibbed tools' or 'The Witcher 3d model Converters'
I recommend to use 3d converters. link - https://jlouisb.users.sourceforge.net/
